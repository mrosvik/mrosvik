## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I work at [The Norwegian Digitalisation Agency (Digdir)](https://www.digdir.no) as the product owner of [Designsystemet](https://www.designsystemet.no), a community-driven, open-source design system.

"Designsystemet" is a shared toolkit with essential UI components, guidelines, and patterns that can be used to develop digital services. It supports efficient product development and cohesive user experiences. While primarily intended for government and public services, itâ€™s also available for anyone seeking to create inclusive digital experiences.

A unified design system is a fundamental step toward ensuring that citizens experience a cohesive, user-centered digital public sector, simplifying their interactions with digital services. Through this system, we establish shared guidelines for components, patterns, user dialogue, accessibility, and inclusive design.
